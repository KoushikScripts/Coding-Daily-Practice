# Coding-Daily-Practice
# üêç 30-Day Python Coding Challenge

This repository documents my journey to learn Python from the ground up, following a structured 30-day plan of increasing difficulty. Each day, I'll tackle a new concept, solve a challenge, and commit the code to track my progress.

## üéØ The Goal

To establish a strong foundation in Python programming, covering basic syntax, data structures, control flow, functions, and modules, by coding a new script every day for 30 consecutive days.
