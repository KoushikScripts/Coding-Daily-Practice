# üöÄ 4-Week Python Accelerator Challenge

This repository documents my accelerated and intensive journey to master Python for advanced applications in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **DevOps/Automation**, and **AI/Machine Learning (AI/ML)**.

---

## üéØ The Goal

To pivot quickly into a specialized Python role by focusing on high-impact concepts and core libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, and Requests) over four focused weeks. The goal is mastery of complex topics rather than basic syntax.

## ‚úÖ Progress Tracker

Check off the tasks as you complete them. Commit your code daily!

### Week 1: Advanced Fundamentals & Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- [ ] **Day 01-02:** Advanced Data Structures (Dictionary vs. `Counter`)
- [ ] **Day 03-04:** Functions: Closures & **Decorators** (Execution Timer)
- [ ] **Day 05-06:** Core OOP: Class, Instance, Methods (`Vehicle` class)
- [ ] **Day 07:** OOP: **Inheritance** & Polymorphism

### Week 2: Dev/Ops Focus (I/O, OS, Concurrency)
- [ ] **Day 08-09:** File I/O and **Context Managers** (CSV to JSON)
- [ ] **Day 10-11:** OS Interaction (`os`, **`subprocess`**)
- [ ] **Day 12-13:** Advanced Exception Handling (Handling specific HTTP Errors)
- [ ] **Day 14:** Concurrency: **`threading`** (Simultaneous Downloads)

### Week 3: Data Science / AI-ML Foundations
- [ ] **Day 15-16:** **NumPy**: Arrays & Vectorization (Dot Product)
- [ ] **Day 17-18:** **Pandas**: DataFrames (Loading, Inspecting, Cleaning)
- [ ] **Day 19-20:** Data Visualization (**`matplotlib`**) (Creating a Histogram/Scatter Plot)
- [ ] **Day 21:** Introduction to **Scikit-learn** (Basic Classifier Model)

### Week 4: Deployment & Automation & Expert Concepts
- [ ] **Day 22-23:** Working with **APIs** (`requests`) (Parsing JSON Data)
- [ ] **Day 24-25:** **Virtual Environments** (`venv`) & `pip` (Setting up `requirements.txt`)
- [ ] **Day 26-27:** Advanced OOP: **Properties** & Magic Methods (`__str__`)
- [ ] **Day 28:** **Logging** & Debugging (Logging to Console and File)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Dependencies

This accelerated plan requires several external libraries essential for DevOps and AI/ML.

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your Repository URL Here]
    ```
2.  **Create a virtual environment** (recommended for clean dependency management):
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies** (assuming you will commit a `requirements.txt` file):
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *(Note: The `requirements.txt` file will be created during **Day 24-25**.)*
